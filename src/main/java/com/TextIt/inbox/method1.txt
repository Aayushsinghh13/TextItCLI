So in method 1 we have made a InputHandler thread (Demon Thread) which runs after a specific interval of time

so this Thread calls two other thread knows as liketracker and follow tracker and wait till this two thread execute

* Like Tracker

--> how it trackes likes so what we do is we have one table which stores (postid (foreign key) , likeid(primary key) , userid (who liked the post) ) ( add some more coloum which must be added)  and other table which stores previous most recent like record ( int rowid (which is always 1 (final)) , previouslikecount , previous followcount)


so or query is

Statement s = con.getstatement(select previous_like_count from previousrecord);
Resultset rs= s.executequery();
if(rs.next()){
int i = rs.getInt(1);
}

//now after getting last liked we will do this

s= con.getstatement(select userid from TABLENAME where likeid>i);

resultset rs = s.executequery();

while(rs.next()){

inboxhandle.notification(rs.getint());

call method of inboxhandler named notification(int userid);

this method execute query --> select username from userinfo where userid = userid;
}

* follow tracker

same method as like tracker
